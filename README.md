# Python-bots- 
I created these files for pure enjoyment. I thought it was interesting using headless browsers and interecting with 
the selenium library was cool, and a great learning experience. It goes to show how easy bots are created, and
it helped me understand why so many large companies like twitter and facebook have created different forms of 
bot checking in their websites
